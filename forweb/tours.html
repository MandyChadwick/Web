            <section class="punta">
                <p class=toursp>Tour Punta Sur. It is the southernmost point of Cozumel and belongs to a large beautiful
                    ecological park. There are reefs, lagoons, and plenty of sunshine. The Celarain lighthouse is a
                    lovely feature, and it is near a nautical museum. There is also local Maya Temple that can be easily
                    accessed. The beaches offer plenty of beautiful white sand, and if you come at the right time of
                    year, you can see the sea turtles nesting. Many come to Punta Sur to scuba dive. It is a lovely
                    place to tour with your Scoots Ride! Once in Punta Sur you can eat at the local food vendors. The
                    tacos at Mario’s taco stand are known through out the region as being fantastic. Also, there are a
                    few craftsmen native to the area who can create for you custom wood or leather work. Don’t forget to
                    climb the lighthouse and see as far as you can. It is possible on a very clear day to see the
                    mainland. Your Scoots Rental will perform wonderfully on the sandy beaches. We have selected each
                    vehicle for its dexterity on the sands of the local beaches. We hope you find time to visit Punta
                    Sur.</p>

                    Visit San Gervasio. The park is a wildlife refuge and has a large iguana population. The iguanas
                    love tourists and are quite curious. It is fantastic to see them run across the sand in large
                    numbers. They look like miniature dinosaurs. Another way to travel back in time is the ruins.
                    Ancient ruins in San Gervasio are extensive and cover several square miles. Many types of ruins
                    dating back to 600BC. These include buildings, alters, courtyards, and temples. You will not be
                    disappointed if you spend a day touring San Gervasio in a cool airconditioned four-door Jeep from
                    Scoots. There are many local legends about San Gervasio. Some say it was a temple and others say it
                    was the palace of the ancient chiefs. There are often archeological digs in the area. There is so
                    much to discover on the little island of Cozumel. Surely the native people and their stories about
                    these ruins are among the more fascinating parts of the experience. Be sure to wear a hat and plenty
                    of sunscreen. The sun beats down most days. However, the area is also known for its hurricane type
                    storms which makes these ruins all the more impressive since they have lasted through the ages.
