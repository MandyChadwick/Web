          <p>There are many easy to distinguish sections on the Costco website homepage. This is a result of proximity. The first grouping is in the header. The header allows for search, warehouse information cart, and account information.  The center of the page is an advertisement for a featured product. Under the large product advertisement, there are several links to other products. The large product and the smaller product options represent a group.  The last grouping at the bottom is an ad for same-day delivery. The Costco site has a large amount of information right on the homepage. It still is easy to read and navigate because of the excellent use of proximity</p>

          <p>The Frontier Charter school website has a distinct visual hierarchy. Unlike the Costco homepage, it has very little information at first glance. The ultimate goal of the charter school site is to enroll students. The register students button is the most prominent button on the homepage. There are very few options on the home page. All other options are tucked away in the small menu on the top right. From that menu, multiple child pages can be accessed. The second most crucial element is the ebook download. This book explains the school's goals, structure, and leadership and acts as both in the informative guide and the school handbook. This school is unique and a bit complex in its organization, and the web designers are pointing the genuinely interested reader to all the details. It is second in the visual hierarchy because many students may enroll because of a good recommendation and not.</p>

          <h2>Alignment</h2>

          <p>Wikipedia uses center alignment and three-column groups. The language options are nicely aligned into three columns. These columns are center-aligned within the column. The title of Wikipedia is center-aligned, as is the subtitle.  The bottom button is also center-aligned. The only thing left-aligned is the curser to search. This creates a distinct difference between the search bar and all other content on the page. It draws attention to the search cursor because of the strong line created by the left edge of a viewer's screen.</p>
